Note: Before doing this tutorial, take note about installing Debian with VMware and configuring to use SSH.

Login as root

```sudo su -```

Open the SSH configuration file

```nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config```

```
# Allow password authentication
PasswordAuthentication yes

# Allow public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Permit root login (not recommended for production)
PermitRootLogin yes

# Specify which users can log in (optional)
AllowUsers your_username

# Listen on default SSH port
Port 22
```

Save and exit the editor (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter)

Restart the SSH service to apply changes

```systemctl restart sshd```

Great choice! Ansible is a powerful and user-friendly tool for automation. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started with Ansible on macOS:

1. Install Ansible:
   The easiest way to install Ansible on macOS is using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first.

   Open Terminal and run:
   ```
   brew install ansible
   ```

2. Verify the installation:
   ```
   ansible --version
   ```

3. Create a directory for your Ansible project:
   ```
   mkdir ~/ansible-project
   cd ~/ansible-project
   ```

4. Create an inventory file:
   ```
   touch inventory.ini
   ```
   Edit this file and add your server's IP or hostname:
   ```
   [servers]
   your_server_ip_or_hostname
   ```

5. Create an Ansible playbook:
   ```
   touch playbook.yml
   ```

6. Edit the playbook.yml file to include tasks for installing Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx. Here's a basic example:

   

   ```yaml
---
   - hosts: servers
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Update apt cache
         apt:
           update_cache: yes

       - name: Install Docker dependencies
         apt:
           name:
             - apt-transport-https
             - ca-certificates
             - curl
             - software-properties-common
           state: present

       - name: Add Docker GPG key
         apt_key:
           url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
           state: present

       - name: Add Docker repository
         apt_repository:
           repo: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu {{ ansible_distribution_release }} stable
           state: present

       - name: Install Docker
         apt:
           name: docker-ce
           state: present

       - name: Install Docker Compose
         get_url:
           url: https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-Linux-x86_64
           dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
           mode: '0755'

       - name: Install Nginx
         apt:
           name: nginx
           state: present

       - name: Start Nginx service
         service:
           name: nginx
           state: started
           enabled: yes
   
```

7. Run the playbook:
   ```
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
   ```

This playbook assumes you're using an Ubuntu-based server. You might need to adjust it based on your specific server OS.

A few things to note:
- Ensure you have SSH access to your server.
- The `--ask-become-pass` flag will prompt for the sudo password on the remote server.
- You may need to adjust the Docker Compose version in the playbook to the latest version.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
