Note: Before doing this tutorial, take note about installing Debian with VMware and configuring to use SSH.

Login as root

```sh
sudo su -
```

Open the SSH configuration file

```sh
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```
# Allow password authentication
PasswordAuthentication yes

# Allow public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Permit root login (not recommended for production)
PermitRootLogin yes

# Specify which users can log in (optional)
AllowUsers your_username

# Listen on default SSH port
Port 22
```

Save and exit the editor (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter)

Restart the SSH service to apply changes

```sh
systemctl restart sshd
```

Check the VM or server IP Address

```sh
ip addr show
```

Great choice! Ansible is a powerful and user-friendly tool for automation. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started with Ansible on macOS:

1. Install Ansible:
   The easiest way to install Ansible on macOS is using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first.

   Open Terminal and run:

```sh
brew install ansible hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass
```

2. Verify the installation:
   ```
   ansible --version
   ```

3. Create a directory for your Ansible project:

```sh
mkdir ~/ansible-project
cd ~/ansible-project
```

4. Create an inventory file:

```sh
touch inventory.ini
```
   Edit this file and add your server's IP or hostname:
   ```
   [servers]
   your_server_ip_or_hostname
   ```

5. Create an Ansible playbook:

```sh
touch install-docker-and-nginx.yml
```

6. Edit the install-docker-and-nginx.yml file to include tasks for installing Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx. Here's a basic example:

   
```yaml
---
- name: Install Docker and Nginx
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Add Docker GPG key
      ansible.builtin.apt_key:
        url: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker repository
      ansible.builtin.apt_repository:
        repo: "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian {{ ansible_distribution_release }} stable"
        state: present

    - name: Update apt cache
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install Docker
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: docker-ce
        state: present

    - name: Install Nginx
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Docker service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: docker
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Start and enable Nginx service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

7. Run the playbook:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install-docker-and-nginx.yml --ask-become-pass
```

This playbook assumes you're using an Ubuntu-based server. You might need to adjust it based on your specific server OS.

A few things to note:
- Ensure you have SSH access to your server.
- The `--ask-become-pass` flag will prompt for the sudo password on the remote server.
- You may need to adjust the Docker Compose version in the playbook to the latest version.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
